# TiffViewer

Browser for multi-page TIFF hyperstack data allowing for masking with points and lines (useful for visualizing graphs).

The browser currently comes in two versions:

* [PyQt Stackbrowser](/"PyQt Stackbrowser"/) - Browser build using PyQt4. Includes support for contrast enhancement, mutiple windows, and has a cleaner user interface.
* [Pygame Stackbrowser](/tree/master/Pygame Stackbrowser/) - Deprecated browser built using Pygame; less feature-rich.
